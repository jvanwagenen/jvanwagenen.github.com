      <p>In 2006, I moved to Italy after graduating with a BA in Italian and English literature from DePaul University.
        As coordinator of the
        language program at an Irish cultural association in Rome, I discovered a passion for teaching second-language
        acquisition as well as literature and other contemporary forms of cultural
        productions. These interests led me to return to the US five years later and pursue a PhD in Italian studies,
        which I completed at Harvard University in 2017. Since then, I have taught Italian-language at Harvard and USC,
        and Italian and comparative literature at
        Tsinghua University. My dissertation analyzed popular Italian countercultural <i>cantautori</i>
        (singer-songwriters) and modern mythologies. This and my other research interests [Italian comics; <i>i western
          all’italiana</i>; immigrant and second-generation
        literature; translation; travel literature; tourism studies; ecological ethics (especially related to tourism)]
        are born out of and feed back into my pedagogical goals in both language and literature/culture courses, as they
        are, to my mind, topics that are of great interest to
        students today and/or are of central importance to the contemporary world. You can read more about my teaching
        philosophy <a href="./pdf/teachingstatement.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
      <!--<p> In 2017, I completed my PhD in Italian Studies at Harvard University where
        I was also a principal at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society’s research lab in Digital Humanities,
        <a href="http://metalab.harvard.edu" target="_blank">metaLAB</a>, and the project coordinator for <a href="http://curarium.com" target="_blank">curarium.com</a>.
        My interest in <a href="http://mlhplayground.org/curarium_sat/" target="_blank">digital curation</a> and collecting goes hand-in-hand with an interest in libraries and their organization,
        and while attending Harvard, I was the head librarian at Harvard's Dudley Library for five years.
        I was previously a writer and teacher in Rome, Italy (2006-2010), and a graduate student researcher at Michigan State University in the Physical Chemistry Department (2010-2011).
        My research interests include modern mythology, Italian and US counterculture, the <a href="http://italiansongwriters.com/songs/il-suonatore-jones/" target="_blank"><i>cantautore</i></a> and singer-songwriter,
        the Far West in cultural imaginations, science and fractalized reality in modern and postmodern US,
        English, Italian and Argentinian literature, the chess set in literature, representations of the infinite, data-curation,
        and the importance of medium in research, teaching and publishing in the Humanities.
        I am currently a Lauro De Bosis Postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University.</a></p>-->
