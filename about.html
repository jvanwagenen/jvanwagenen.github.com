      <p> In May 2017, I will complete my PhD in Italian Studies at Harvard University where
        I am also a principal at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society’s research lab in Digital Humanities,
        metaLAB and the project coordinator for curarium.com.
        My interest in curation and collecting goes hand-in-hand with an interest in libraries and their organization,
        and while attending Harvard, I have been the head librarian at Dudley Library since 2012.
        I was previously a graduate student researcher at Michigan State University in the Physical Chemistry Department
        studying the atmosphere of white-dwarf stars, and a presenter and night-sky guide at Abram’s Planetarium.
        My research interests include modern mythology, Italian and US counterculture, the cantautore and singer-songwriter,
        the Far West in cultural imagination, science and fractalized reality in modern and post-modern American,
        English, Italian and Spanish literature, the chess set in literature, representations of the infinite, data-curation,
        and the importance of medium in both research and publishing in the Humanities. </p>
